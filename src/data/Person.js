        "Technology has always been the forefront of enhancing the human experience. As people become more connected, information is easier than ever to access and it is important for interfaces to be intuitive for users to find what they are looking for.",
        "Inspiration for my career in software development first came about from folks modifying computer games from seriousness to something silly. I wanted to try something similar and started to browse and modify sound-bytes within my favorite games to make them how I want. As time went on I delved into modifying graphics, models, and eventually learned about programming.",
        "So far in my career I have been handling large data sets to present users how they are recovering following a medical procedure, or showing how utility customers are reducing their carbon footprint over time. Overall my passion is providing information to people to learn from and help with decision making, software development is the perfect means of doing so in a connected world.",
        "Outside of development I have been exploring virtual worlds through VR gaming; although I still havenâ€™t forgotten about the real-world (yet) and equally enjoy explore local places and getting to know folks all around both inside and outside the software development industry. I also enjoy expressing my creative side through computer graphics, 3D modeling, and drawing...anything that brings thoughts to life."
